Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With a small number of simulations......??????

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: Prediction stabilises after about 100000 simulations.
